        <h2>Bhiksha Nahi Shiksha Do</h2>
        <p>The theme "Bhiksha Nahi Shiksha Do" aims to free children from begging and labor, bringing them into the path of education. Child begging is a significant issue in India today, with millions of children pushed into begging by their own parents. Today's children are tomorrow's wealth, and education is a basic right. However, it remains a distant dream for many exploited and impoverished children who are forced into begging. Their dreams are shattered as they wander through crowded streets, tea shops, markets, over bridges, at traffic signals, and on buses and trains, pleading with innocent eyes from every passerby.

Despite the passing of decades since the enactment of the Children Act in 1960, child begging remains a pressing concern. According to our study, 80% of children aged 6 to 14 years in the city are increasingly turning towards begging. In 99% of cases, these children are forced to beg by their parents, who often avoid seeking work themselves. The children earn an average of Rs. 500 per day through begging—around Rs. 15,000 per month—more than what many daily wage earners bring home. Consequently, parents become complacent and make their children beg.'</p>
